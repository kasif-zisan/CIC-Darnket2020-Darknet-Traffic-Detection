# CIC-Darnket2020-Darknet-Traffic-Detection
This repository contains my Jupyter Notebook where I predicted Darknet traffic using the CIC-Darknet2020 dataset. I used Decision Tree Classifier and Logistic Regression for the traffic prediction. I also showed difference between the performance of the two models.
